My Gameboy Game
===============

This is the Gameboy Advance Game I made as a student in CS 2110.

To build it, you will probably need the following Debian/Ubuntu
packages: gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi. To run it, you will
need a GBA emulator such as Visual Boy Advance (recommended) or
Mednafen. Building and running goes something like:

    $ make
    $ vba ted.gba # or whatever emulator you want

For the controls, see readme.txt.

The code is not beautiful since it was made in a week, but it works.
