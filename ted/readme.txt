                  advance title brought to you
                      by mr. austin adams

                          CS 2110-B1
                            4/4/17

      For as long as he can remember (that is, several
      minutes), young Ted has dreamed a dream: to enter the
      purplish door on the other side of the room without
      tripping on toxic waste and dying. There's only one
      catch: he must be right side up — Ted is a poor acrobat
      — and must fit into the door, y'know, laws of physics
      and all.

      With your help, you can help Ted fulfill his dreams.
      In his limited... capabilities, Ted can do two things:
      roll sideways, and stretch or retract his neck while
      he's heads-up or heads-down. If you count gravity, Ted
      can do a third: falling when he straightens up beside
      a ledge.

      To stretch Ted, use the up and down arrows (up and
      down in VisualBoyAdvance-M), and to roll him, use the
      left and right bumper-things (A and S in VBA-M). To
      advance through any screen or restart the game, press
      select (backspace in VBA-M).

      Enjoy!
